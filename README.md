# Data Analysis and Visualisation: Characterising E. coli Proteins CsgG and CsgF for Nanopore Sequencing


### Background

This study focuses on two proteins from the Escherichia coli membrane protein complex: CsgG and CsgF. These proteins are being explored as potential nanopores for DNA sequencing. To aid protein engineering efforts to improve their sequencing capabilities, a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CsgG and the CsgG-CsgF complex were conducted to analyse their conformational dynamics and mechanical strength.


### Data Analysis and Visualisation

In the Jupyter notebook, data from the MD simulations of CsgG and the CsgG-CsgF complex (in the directory `csgg_data_rattu_2021`) are analysed and visualised. These analyses provide key insights into the properties relevant for nanopore DNA sequencing.
